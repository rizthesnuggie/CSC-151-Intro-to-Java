/*Write a program that declares a constant named QUARTS_IN_GALLON which holds the number of quarts in a gallon (there are 4 quarts to a gallon). Also declare a variable named quartsNeeded to represent the number of quarts needed for a painting job, and assign an appropriate value. Compute and display the number of gallons and quarts needed for the job. Display explanatory text with the valuesâ€”for example, A job that needs 18 quarts requires 4 gallons plus 2 quarts.

    When submitting the program for testing/grading, assign the value 18 to quartsNeeded.
